# News article classification
This project aims to provide the ability to classify news articles into 5 categories: news, business, tech, sports and entertainment. \
The dataset used for training was provided by Dr Nedjma Djouhra Ousidhoum and by Dr Jose Camacho Collados. 
## Setting up the environment
Make sure python and jupyter are installed. \
There are a few python modules that need to be installed also: \
pandas, random, numpy, nltk, sklearn, operator, requests, gensim \
Make sure that the bbc-text.csv file is in the same folder as the jupyter notebook.
## Running the code
Open the jupyter notebook and run each code block. Note that loading the Google News word2vec model can take a while.
